### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I love helping people leverage the power of data and software. I've had the
privilege of doing so in various roles for over 25 years. My specialty is
working with stakeholders to develop extensible scheduling,
[workflow](https://delonnewman.name/history/workflow), and
[form systems](https://delonnewman.name/history/form-system). I also love
[teaching](https://delonnewman.name/history/teaching) and [mentoring](https://delonnewman.name/history/mentoring).
Currently, most of my work is with [Ruby](https://delonnewman.name/history/ruby)
and [JavaScript](https://delonnewman.name/history/javascript).

### Work

I'm available for freelance or contract work. Hard problems with no clear cut solution
are the most interesting to me. I may also be able to
[help you get projects started](https://delonnewman.name/projects/punchedit),
[complete stalled projects](https://delonnewman.name/projects/surveyor),
and coach teams on things like system design, and dealing with the technical challenges
around modeling sparsely structured data (especially in healthcare and clinical research).

You'll find a reasonably complete summary of my experience [here](https://delonnewman.name/history)
(there's an abbreviated version in PDF format [here](https://delonnewman.name/resume.pdf)).
Feel free to reach out to me by [email](mailto:contact@delonnewman.name)
or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/delonnewman).
