### Hi there! 👋

I'm a programmer. I've been doing this for what seems to me to be a long time.

Since I'm learning that so much of what we do is governed by our perspective and what we value, here's a brief summary of what I tend to value, so you can have a sense for whether I'd be a good fit for your team.

I tend to value:

🧗‍♀️ *Independence over thoughtless conformity*,

🤝 *Cooperation over independence*,

🤔 *Thoughful action over assumptions (best practices, good or bad, are assumptions; this could also be stated "principles over rules")*,

🤷‍♀️ *Common sense over philosophical bias (thoughfulness, however well intended, tends to lead to philosophical biases)*,

⛏️ *Clear evidence over common sense (common sense, while a good fall back when there is no clear evidence, is limited by experience but, on the other hand ✋ clear evidence is much harder to come by than the internet, and often the classroom, would have us believe)*,

🗓️ *Planning & processes over a free for all*,

📣 *Communication over processess*,

🏋️‍♂️ *Building over planning*,

🛠️ *Technology over human suffering (technology&mdash;particularly in the broad sense of applied technique)*,

❤️ *People over technology* 🧍🏻‍♀🧍🏿‍♂️👨🏼‍🦽💃🏽 👩🏻‍🦯‍➡️🏃🏻‍♂️‍➡️🕺🏽🧎🏾‍♂️‍➡️.

For the bottom line people&mdash;I currently work with [Ruby](https://ruby-lang.org) & [JavaScript](https://javascript.info) for the most part. Though I've worked with most things in the mainstream and a few things that are not so mainstream. I tend to think more like a [Lisp](https://lisp-lang.org) or [Smalltalk](https://squeak.org) programmer (these days more and more it seems, I apologize in advance 😅).  I'm also comfortable with SQL, Java, Clojure and C.

Oh! and I love math, teaching & design. ❤️ to all who read this.
