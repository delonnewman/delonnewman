### Hi there! üëã

I'm a programmer (as I assume so many of you are). I've been doing this for what seems to me to be a long time.

Since I'm learning (no doubt I'm learning this later than most üòÖ) that so much of what we do is governed by our perspective and what we value. Here's a brief summary of what I tend to value, so you can have a sense for whether I'd be a good fit for your team.

I tend to value:

*Independence over mindless conformity*,

*Cooperation over independence*,

*Thoughful action over assumptions (best practices, good or bad, are assumptions; this could also be stated "principles over rules")*,

*Common sense over philosophical bias (thoughfulness however well intended seems to lead philosophical biases)*,

*Clear evidence over common sense (common sense, while a good fall back when there is no clear evidence is limited by experience, but clear evidence is much harder to come by than the internet, and often the classroom would have us believe ‚õèÔ∏è)*,

*Well defined processes over a free for all*,

*Communication and people over processess*,

*Improvement over perfection*,

*Technology over human suffering*,

*Humans over technology*.

For the bottom line people&mdash;I currently work with [Ruby](https://ruby-lang.org) & [JavaScript](https://javascript.info) for the most part. Though I've worked with most things in the mainstream and a few things that are not so mainstream. I tend to think more like [Lisp](https://lisp-lang.org) or [Smalltalk](https://squeak.org) programmer (these days more and more it seems, I appologize in advance üòÖ).  I'm also comfortable with SQL, Java, Clojure and C.

Oh! and I love Math, Teaching & Design. ‚ù§Ô∏è to all who read this.
